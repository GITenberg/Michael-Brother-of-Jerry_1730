description: Very early in my life, possibly because of the insatiable curiosity that
  was born in me, I came to dislike the performances of trained animals. It was my
  curiosity that spoiled for me this form of amusement, for I was led to seek behind
  the performance in order to learn how the performance was achieved. And what I found
  behind the brave show and glitter of performance was not nice. It was a body of
  cruelty so horrible that I am confident no normal person exists who, once aware
  of it, could ever enjoy looking on at any trained-animal turn. Written from a dog's
  perspective, the book showcases the intelligence and bravery of our canine companions.
